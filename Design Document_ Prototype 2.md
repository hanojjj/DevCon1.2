**Design Document: Prototype 2**

**Objective statement:**   
Have the player change skins to access different areas. How will the player *solve* the puzzle presented to them? 

**Design Rationale:**  
The goal for this mechanic was to create an obstacle/puzzle that the player would have to solve to continue gameplay. When the player solves the puzzle (changing their skin to go through the barrier) the player will be expected to feel a sense of accomplishment after solving the puzzle.

**2D or 3D:** 3D game

Player: Greg (again) 

**Controls:**  
W \= move forward  
S \= move backwards  
A \= move left  
D \= move right  
Space \= Jump

**Rules:** 

- Players can only use one skin at a time

- Use assets from Unity asset store  
- Not long gameplay
